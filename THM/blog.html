      <h2>The Highway Men: Bringing Order to 6b6t’s Chaos</h2>


      While the majority of the maps of Minecraft anarchy servers are chaos, some players bring order with their
      efforts. From building bases to building highways, there are many ways to build, instead of destroy on 6b6t. The
      group that influences the casual 6b6t players the most is The Highway Men. For many months now, they have helped
      to order the nether highways of 6b6t. It has made travel faster than ever.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-spawn">The Spawn</h2>
      <p>
        6b6t is over 3 years old, and the map is even older because of the merge with 7b7t.me. The age of the spawn
        results in significant destruction in all dimensions on 6b6t. The spawn on Minecraft servers is where you first
        joined. On anarchy servers, it is often many thousand blocks big. As players progress, it is easier to return to
        spawn and destroy it. This process happened countless times on 6b6t.
      </p>
      <h3 id="events">Events</h3>
      <p>
        While individual players often grief the spawn themselves by building lavacasts, sometimes groups of players
        work together to create huge griefs together, like the water cube on 6b6t made by Myniany, stef4ako and Garajik
        or
        <a href="https://blog.6b6t.org/17-players-from-555-are-shutting-down-access-to-6b6t-on-october-31st/"
          rel="noreferrer" class="a">the pyramid made by 555</a>. Other groups, like The Highway Men, which we discuss
        in this post, create order at spawn by building highways.

      <h2 id="the-highways">The Highways</h2>
      <p>
        Highways are wide, obsidian roads. They lead for millions of blocks. You use them by walking or with an elytra.
        Since 6b6t has /tpa and /home commands, highways are not used as often, but they're still very important. They
        allow players to travel to any location without using any commands. Some popular locations are the world border
        or griefed bases, as well as your own locations for your base.
      </p>
      <p>
        Highways suffer regular damage from withers and players, which complicates travel.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-highway-men">The Highway Men</h2>
      <p>
        On 12th September 2024, mingailas started The Highway Men. His motivation was to restore the highway systems in
        the Nether on 6b6t. Since then, Volizray, xm4nn_, CapyKing10, CaT_345, and others have joined to help.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole group clears 100k blocks daily, on average. This helps the server and restores order to the highways.
        While the focus is on the Nether dimension, the group works in all three dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to expand one of the nether highways to the nether world border in the near future on 6b6t.
